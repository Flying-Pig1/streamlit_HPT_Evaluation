yanlin_chart_1.jpg,what does the image mean,medium,"The image is a pie chart that illustrates the pass rates of different stages in the interview process. The chart is divided into six distinct sections, each representing a different stage of the interview process. The stages are as follows: application, brief interview by HR, testing, revealing some other information, interview with the director, and offer. Each section of the chart is filled with a different color and labeled with the corresponding stage name and its pass rate. The pass rate for each stage is indicated as a percentage, with the highest pass rate being 100% and the lowest pass rate being 15%. The chart provides a clear and concise overview of the interview process and the likelihood of passing each stage.","The image is a pie chart that illustrates the pass rates of various stages of the interview process. It shows that the application stage has a 100% pass rate, followed by the brief interview by HR with a 70%-30% pass rate. The testing stage has a 17%-23% pass rate, and the revealing of some other information stage has a 38%-19% pass rate. The interview with the director has a 15%-29% pass rate, and the offer stage has a 20%-5% pass rate.","The image is a visual representation of a process, specifically a hiring process, depicted as a funnel chart. The chart is titled ""The Pass Rates of Interviewing,"" which indicates that it is showing the percentage of candidates who pass each stage of the interview process. The stages are listed vertically along the left side of the funnel, starting from the top with ""Application"" and ending at the bottom with ""Offer."" Each stage is color-coded, with the colors corresponding to the legend on the right side of the image. The legend also includes the percentage of candidates who pass each stage, indicated by the color's shade.

Starting from the top, the application stage has a 100% pass rate, meaning all candidates who apply are considered. The pass rate then decreases as we move down the funnel. After the application, the next stage is the ""Brief Interview by HR,"" which has a pass rate of 70%, with a range of 30% to 70%. This suggests that 30% of the candidates who apply pass the interview, while 70% do not. The next stage, ""Testing,"" has a pass rate of 57%, with a range of 13% to 57%. This means that 13% of the candidates who passed the interview also passed the testing phase, while 57% did not. Following that, ""Revealing some other information"" has a pass rate of 38%, with a range of 19% to 38%. This indicates that 19% of those who passed testing also passed this stage, while 38% did not. Finally, the ""Interview with the director"" has a pass rate of 15%, with a range of 23% to 15%, and the ""Offer"" stage has a pass rate of 10%, with a range of 5% to 10%. This means that 23% of those who passed the interview with the director also passed the offer stage, while 10% did not.

The chart visually represents the decreasing number of candidates as they progress through each stage of the interview process, with the largest number of candidates at the application stage and the smallest at the offer stage.",4.0,4.0,4.0,

xzx_chart_7.png,Is this stock going up?,easy,Yes,"Yes, the stock is going up.","Based on the candlestick chart provided, the stock appears to be in a consolidation phase. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the Trend**: The candlestick chart shows a series of green and red candles, which represent the stock's price movements over a specific period.

2. **Look for Patterns**: The pattern of the candles suggests a consolidation phase. Consolidation is when the price moves sideways after a significant rise or fall. The presence of multiple green and red candles without a clear trend indicates this.

3. **Evaluate Volume**: The volume bars at the bottom of the chart show the trading volume for each day. A significant increase in volume during a consolidation phase can indicate a potential breakout, but in this chart, the volume seems relatively consistent, which doesn't provide a strong indication of a breakout.

4. **Consider the Time Frame**: The chart covers a period of a few months, and without additional context, it's hard to determine if this is a short-term or long-term consolidation. However, the lack of a clear trend over this period suggests a possible short-term consolidation.

5. **Look for External Factors**: External factors such as economic news, company reports, or industry trends can influence stock prices. Without additional information, it's challenging to determine the exact cause of the consolidation.

6. **Assess the Stock's Position**: The stock is currently trading at 380,400, which is slightly above the 375,000 mark. If the stock were in a downtrend, we would expect to see lower highs and lower lows, but here, the highs are relatively stable.

In conclusion, the stock appears to be in a consolidation phase, but without additional data or context, it's difficult to predict the future direction of the stock.",2.0,2.0,4.0,

Be sure why it would be a great thing if schools would be able cell phones in school. Cell phones have been an issue in schools ever since they became a bug thing amongst teenagers. Sixth grade Amber H. says, ""There could be an emergency that no one knows about, and the school wouldn't be able to find out. It's important to have a way to get help."" But Amber's teacher, Mrs. Smith, says that there isn't being them and they are turned off and hidden so that they don't disturb anybody. Teachers shouldn't be allowed to take cell phones when they aren't even bothering anyone they are put on silent and they are hidden from other students. Mrs. Smith says, ""I don't think it's a good idea to have cell phones in school. She had her cell phone taken away. It was in her backpack turned off to disturb you when the teacher saw she and took it away and she never had it returned to her!"" I wasn't even using it and the teacher saw it in my backpack and confiscated it!"" I tried to explain that I had to have for later that day when my parents was over but the wouldn't let me. So I had to take it home and put it in my backpack for reasons that only I have there teacher confiscate it! You live in lower Manhattan and your school goes to school nearby.

It discusses the issue of cell phones in schools, comparing the strict rules of today to the past when children could sometimes call their mothers at school.

Another student, Mimi W., emphasizes the importance of having cell phones in school for emergencies. The article also references a hypothetical situation where a child in lower Manhattan hears a loud bang and looks out the window to see the North Tower of the twin towers in flames on September 11th, 2001, and the principal's voice blares over the speaker instructing students to use their cell phones to call their parents.

The lotus is positioned centrally in the frame, drawing the viewer's attention to its delicate petals and the intricate details of its structure. The background is blurred, creating a bokeh effect that further emphasizes the sharpness and clarity of the lotus.

yanlin_math_2.png,what is the answer,medium,27,25,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given equations and the symbols used. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. The first equation shows a soccer ball subtracted from a shuttlecock, which equals 9. This means the shuttlecock is 9 more than the soccer ball.

2. The second equation shows the shuttlecock multiplied by the soccer ball, which equals 25. This means the shuttlecock is 25 times the value of the soccer ball.

3. The third equation shows the soccer ball plus the shuttlecock, which also equals 25. This means the value of the soccer ball is 25 minus the value of the shuttlecock.

Now, let's solve for the value of the shuttlecock:

Step 1: From the first equation, we know the shuttlecock is 9 more than the soccer ball. Let's call the value of the soccer ball x.

Step 2: From the second equation, we know the shuttlecock is 25 times x.

Step 3: From the third equation, we know the soccer ball plus the shuttlecock equals 25.

Using the second equation, we can substitute x for the value of the shuttlecock (25x) to get:

25x = 25

Dividing both sides by 25, we get:

x = 1

So, the value of the shuttlecock is 1.

Now, we can go back to the first equation and substitute the value of the shuttlecock (1) for the soccer ball (x):

9 + 1 = 25

Adding 9 to both sides gives us:

10 + 1 = 25

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

20 = 25

This is a contradiction because 20 is not equal to 25. Therefore, there is no solution that makes all three equations consistent.

2. The second equation shows three pieces of watermelon slices and one orange, which we'll represent by the letter ""O."" The sum of these items is 28. 

3. The third equation shows one orange and one banana, which we'll represent by the letter ""B."" The difference between these two items is 3.

Now, let's apply the information we have:

- Since the sum of three watermelon slices is 36, we can deduce that the value of one watermelon slice is 12 (36 divided by 3).

- Since the sum of three watermelon slices and one orange is 28, we can deduce that the value of one orange is 8 (28 divided by 4).

- Since the difference between one orange and one banana is 3, we can deduce that the value of one banana is 1 (3 minus 8).

Now that we have the values for the orange and banana, we can solve the remaining equations:

- For the first equation, three watermelon slices (12 each) would equal 36.

- For the second equation, three watermelon slices (12 each) and one orange (8 each) would equal 28.

- For the third equation, one watermelon slice (12) minus one banana (1) equals 11.

The figure itself is a cloverleaf shape, which can be divided into four equal parts, each shaped like a quarter of a circle.

Let's calculate the area of one quarter of a circle:

The radius of a circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. The area of a quarter of a circle is calculated by taking half of the area of a circle.

The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where r is the radius.

For a quarter of a circle, the radius is half of the diameter, so r = ½d.

Using the formula, A = π(½d)^2, we get:

A = π(½d)^2

Now, we need to find the diameter (d) of the circle to calculate the area of one quarter.

The diameter is twice the radius, so d = 2r.

Plugging in the values we have:

A = π(½(2r))^2
A = πr^2

Since the area of the entire figure is divided into four equal parts, we multiply the area of one quarter by 4 to get the total area of the figure:

A = 4πr^2

Now, we need to find the radius (r) of the circle to complete the calculation.

Using the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr^2, and the fact that the area of the entire figure is 3cm^2, we can rearrange the formula to solve for r:

πr^2 = 3cm^2

Taking the square root of both sides gives us:

r = √(3/π)

Plugging in the value of π = 3.14159, we get:

r ≈ 0.57735 cm

The radius of the circle is approximately 0.57735 cm.

Using this radius, we can now calculate the area of one quarter of the circle:

A = π(0.57735)^2
A ≈ 3.324cm^2

Since the entire figure is divided into four equal parts, we multiply this area by 4 to get the total area of the figure:

A = 4(3.324cm^2)
A ≈ 13.296cm^2

Therefore, the area of the figure is approximately 13.296cm^2.",2.0,2.0,2.0,

1. **Identify the Variables and Constants**: In the equation, we have two variables, represented by the square brackets, and one constant, which is the number 10.

2. **Separate the Variables**: The equation has two equations within it. We need to separate them to solve each one individually.

3. **Solve the First Equation**: The first equation is a simple addition problem: 10 + 5 = 15. To solve for the variable, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 10 - 5 = 5. Therefore, the variable is 5.

4. **Solve the Second Equation**: The second equation is a subtraction problem: 10 - 3 = 7. To solve for the variable, we add 3 to both sides of the equation: 10 + 3 = 13. Therefore, the variable is 13.

5. **Substitute the Variables into the Original Equations**: Now that we have the values of the variables, we can substitute them back into the original equations:

Since we know that it takes 10 minutes to saw a piece of wood into 3 pieces, we can set up a proportion to find out how many minutes it will take to saw the wood into 6 pieces:

10 minutes / 3 pieces = x minutes / 6 pieces

Cross-multiplying, we get:

10 * 6 = 3 * x
60 = 3x
x = 60 / 3
x = 20

So, it will take 20 minutes to saw the wood into 6 pieces.","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes it will take to saw a piece of wood into 6 pieces, given that it takes 10 minutes to saw a piece of wood into 3 pieces.

We can set up a proportion to find the answer:

10 minutes / 3 pieces = x minutes / 6 pieces

Cross-multiplying, we get:

10 * 6 = 3 * x

Simplifying, we find:

60 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 20

So, it will take 20 minutes to saw a piece of wood into 6 pieces.","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of pieces and the time taken to saw the wood. The text indicates that it takes 10 minutes to saw the wood into 3 pieces.

Let's represent the time taken to saw the wood into 3 pieces as t, and the time taken to saw it into 6 pieces as t'. According to the problem, t = 10 minutes. We can set up the proportion:

t' / 6 = t / 3

Now, we can solve for t':

t' = 6 * t / 3
t' = 2 * t

Since we know t = 10 minutes, we can substitute this into the equation to find t':

b) How old is her brother now?","To solve the two questions in the figure, we need to use the information given and apply it to determine the missing ages.

Question 1:
Mrs. Lee is 30 years older than her daughter, Jane.

Step 1: Start with Jane's current age.
Step 2: Add 30 years to Jane's current age to find Mrs. Lee's current age.
Step 3: Subtract Jane's current age from Mrs. Lee's current age to find the difference in their ages.

Jane's current age is not provided, but we can set up the equation:
Jane's age = Mrs. Lee's age - 30

Question 2:
Jane's brother is 3 years younger.

Step 1: Start with Jane's current age.
Step 2: Subtract 3 years from Jane's current age to find her brother's current age.

Jane's current age is not provided, but we can set up the equation:
Jane's age = brother's age + 3

Now, we can use the information from the first question to find Jane's age.

From the first question, we know Mrs. Lee's current age is 30 + Jane's age = 33 years old.

Using the second equation, Jane's age = brother's age + 3, we can substitute Mrs. Lee's age into the equation:
Jane's age = 33 - brother's age + 3.

We now have two equations:
Jane's age = 33 - brother's age + 3
Jane's age = brother's age + 3 - 33

To solve for Jane's age, we need to solve the second equation for brother's age first.

Brother's age = Jane's age - 3 + 33

Now, we can substitute the solution for brother's age back into the first equation:
Jane's age = 33 - (Jane's age - 3 + 33) + 3

Jane's age = 33 - (Jane's age - 3) + 3

Jane's age = 33 - Jane's age + 6

Jane's age = 33 - Jane's age

Jane's age = 33 - 33

Jane's age = 0

Jane is 0 years old.

Question 3:
Jane's brother is 3 years younger.

Step 1: Start with Jane's current age.
Step 2: Subtract 3 years from Jane's current age to find her brother's current age.

Jane's current age is not provided, but we can set up the equation:
Jane's age = brother's age + 3

Using the information from the first question, we know Mrs. Lee's current age is 33 - Jane's age = 30 years old.

Using the second equation, Jane's age = brother's age + 3, we can substitute Mrs. Lee's age into the equation:
Mrs. Lee's age = Jane's age - 3 + 30

Mrs. Lee's age = Jane's age - 3 + 30

Mrs. Lee's age = Jane's age + 27

The expression 8 - 2i is written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. The value of a is 8, and the value of b is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 8 3.","The correct answer is D) 11/3. To find the value of a + bi that represents the expression 8 - i divided by 3 - 2i, we follow these steps:

1. First, we subtract the imaginary part from both the numerator and denominator to eliminate the i term from the denominator.
   So, 8 - i becomes 7, and 3 - 2i becomes 1.

2. Next, we subtract the real part of the numerator from the real part of the denominator to eliminate the i term from the numerator.
   So, 7 - 3 becomes 4.

3. Finally, we subtract the imaginary part of the numerator from the imaginary part of the denominator to eliminate the i term from the numerator.
   So, -1 - (-2i) becomes -1 + 2i.

Now, we have simplified the expression to 4 + 2i. Since the expression represents a complex number, we can write it in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.

4. To find a, we add the real parts of the simplified expression: 4 + 2i = 6 + 2i.

5. To find b, we subtract the imaginary part of the simplified expression from the imaginary part of the original expression: -1 - (-2i) = -1 + 2i.

6. Therefore, b = 2i.

7. Since a is the real part of the complex number, we have a = 6.

8. Therefore, the complex number in the form a + bi is 6 + 2i.

9. Since the original expression is 8 - i divided by 3 - 2i, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the i term from the denominator.

   So, (8 - i) * (3 - 2i) = (8 - i) * (3 + 2i) = 24 - 2i - i = 23 - i.

10. Since the expression represents a complex number, we can write it in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.

11. Therefore, a = 23, and b = -1.

12. The expression 8 - i divided by 3 - 2i is equivalent to 23 - i divided by 3 + 2i.

13. Since the expression in the form a + bi is 23 - i, we can determine the value of a from the given information.

14. Therefore, the value of a is 23.

15. The value of b is -1.

16. Therefore, the complex number in the form a + bi is 23 - i.

17. Since the original expression is 8 - i divided by 3 - 2i, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the i term from the denominator.

   So, (8 - i) * (3 - 2i) = (8 - i) * (3 + 2i) = 24 - 2i - i = 23 - i.

18. Since the expression represents a complex number, we can write it in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.

19. Therefore, a = 23, and b = -1.

20. Therefore, the value of a is 23.

pc_math_15.png,"Choose the correct answer, and explain the reason",difficult,"The correct answer is (A) 2.5. 

The question asks for the value of p, which is given by the equation y = x + b, where b is a constant. The point with coordinates (2p, 5r) lies on the line with equation y = 2x + b. If p = 0, then the point is (0, 5r), which is on the line. Therefore, the value of p is 2.5.","The correct answer is B) 4.

Reasoning:
In the xy-plane, the point (p, r) lies on the line with equation y = x + b, where b is a constant. The point with coordinates (2p, 5r) lies on this line. We can substitute the values of p and r into the equation of the line to find the value of b. 

2p + b = 5r

We are given the value of r, which is 5. We can substitute this value into the equation:

2p + b = 5

Now, we can solve for b:

b = 5 - 2p

Since we are looking for the value of b, we can choose any value of p that makes the equation true. Let's choose p = 2:

b = 5 - 2(2) = 5 - 4 = 1

So, the value of b is 1.","The correct answer is D) 5/2. Here's the reasoning:

Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. We are given that the point (p, r) lies on a line with the equation y = x + b.
2. We are also given that the point with coordinates (2p, 5r) lies on a different line with the equation y = 2x + b.

Now, let's derive the equation of the line through (2p, 5r) using the given information:

Since (2p, 5r) lies on the line y = 2x + b, we can substitute the coordinates (2p, 5r) into the equation to find the value of b:

y = 2x + b
y = 2(2p) + b
y = 4p + b

Now, we can use the given coordinates (2p, 5r) to find the value of b:

b = y - 2x
b = 5r - 4(2p)
b = 5r - 8p
b = 5r - 8p + 8p
b = 5r

Therefore, the equation of the line through (2p, 5r) is y = 5x.

Since the point (p, r) lies on a different line with the equation y = x + b, we can substitute the coordinates (p, r) into the equation to find the value of b:

y = x + b
y = p + b

Now, we can use the given coordinates (p, r) to find the value of b:

b = y - x
b = r - p
b = r - p + p
b = r

Therefore, the equation of the line through (p, r) is y = x.

Comparing the two equations, we can see that the slope of the line through (2p, 5r) is 5/2, and the slope of the line through (p, r) is 1. Since the slope of a line is a constant, these two lines are not parallel, and the correct answer is D) 5/2.",1.0,1.0,1.0,

The correct answer is A(18, -4) because it is the point that divides line AB into a ratio of 3:2, starting from point A. This means that the x-coordinate of point A is 18 and the y-coordinate is -4.","The correct answer is B (2, 46).

The question asks for the point that divides line AB into a ratio of 3:2, starting from point A (-18, -4). To find this point, we can use the concept of division ratios in geometry. 

Let's assume that the point we're looking for is P. Since line AB is divided into a ratio of 3:2, we can represent this as:

P = (3/5)A + (2/5)A

Now, we can substitute the coordinates of point A (-18, -4) into the equation:

P = (3/5)(-18) + (2/5)(-4)

P = (-27/5) + (-8/5)

P = (-27 - 8)/5

P = -35/5

P = (-35/5, -46/5)

So, the point that divides line AB into a ratio of 3:2, starting from point A (-18, -4), is P (-35/5, -46/5).","The correct answer is B) (2,46). The point that divides line AB into a ratio of 3:2, starting from A, is the point where the line intersects the line perpendicular to AB at a distance of 2 units from A. Since the line perpendicular to AB is y = -x + 18, the point is (2,46). This is because when x = 2, y = -2 + 18 = 16.",1.0,2.0,1.0,
