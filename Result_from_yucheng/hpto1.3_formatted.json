Kids today still have to call their mothers sometimes! But they won't let them. \nSchools have become much more strict about the phones even in an emergency \nsometimes. So where's why it would be a great thing if schools would use cell phones in \nschool. \nCell phones have been an issue in schools forever since we became a bug thing amongst teenagers. Sixth grader Amber H., says, \"There could be an emergency that no one knew \nabout until someone tried to reach her on the phone!\" In fact of school leaders make it for \nThey take students cell phones when they aren't using them and they are turned off and hidden so that they don't disturb anybody. Teachers shouldn't be allowed to take cell phones \nwhen they aren't being bothered anywhere else but put on silent and they are hidden from other classmates.Just two years ago in October a girl took the case to the Supreme Court.She had \nhad her cell phone taken away. I was at her backpack turned off and disturbing anyone when \nthe teacher saw it and took it away and she never had it returned to her! \n\"I wasn't even suing it and the teacher saw it my backpack and confiscated it\" I tried \nto explain that I had to have it for later that day when my practice was over but he wouldn't listen.\" She says bring their cell phones to school for reasons like that only because it's \nlater teacher confiscate it. \nImagine this... You live in lower Manhattan and your child goes to school nearby. It's September 11th,2001. You are working quietly and suddenly hear a loud bang and look out \nyour window. Suddenly there is panic everywhere then all the teachers yell fire alarm! A year passes by and you haven't heard anything yet. Have you ever wondered what happened? \nHave been alerted. Suddenly the intercom comes and the principal's voice blares over the \nspeaker,\" Students, get out your cell phones and call your parents immediately\". They could use \nthe speech phones but not only is there a line to use the phones the first person finds out the \nintercom system has failed and can't dial any numbers except those that say police or ambulance \nbut to many students using five or six cell phones wouldn't think that the battery would die \nout? How would a child reach their parents to tell them that they are ok?\" They cannot! \nIn emergencies like this its very important to have a way for a child to reach their parents! \nSixth grader Emily W. says, \"We need them to school because if there was an emergency and we couldn't see the school (phones) for one reason or another we would pull our own phones' \nWorkshop & Beasley    Write in the Middle"

        "hpto1.3_resp": "[ABSTRACT] Incomplete information game (IIG) exists widely in real life, such as military resources allocation, commercial competition, social governance and so on. Because of the reward feedback in the game process, reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising technique for solving such complex problems. Meanwhile, it is critical to obtain valuable information by analyzing opponent's behaviors. Based on uncertainty modeling in IIG, this thesis proposes an RL algorithm with opponent models, in order to respond adaptively to different types of opponents. Theoretically, this thesis proposes three methods to measure uncertainty in IIG: utility fluctuation method, regret value method, and information entropy method, which will be applied to th proposed uncertainty-based RL algorithm.Multiple combinations of opponent models & decision networks are also applied to target different types of opponents. More specifically, three model selection methods are proposed: threshold scheduling method, learning scheduling method,and analysis scheduling method. In order to fully consider the uncertainty, this thesis innovatively adopts the Q-Learning algorithm based on the uncertainty in the decision network. A set of sub-networks for modelling opponents and model selection methods finally constitute the uncertaint- based RL algorithm with opponent models in this thesis."

The flower is the central focus of the image, with its six delicate petals surrounding a bright yellow center that radiates light from within. Each petal curves gently outwards, creating an intricate pattern around the core.\n\nThe background is awash with dark green hues, providing a stark contrast to the striking color of the lotus. This backdrop appears blurred and out of focus, further emphasizing the sharp details of the flower itself. Despite this, one can discern the presence of other leaves or stems beneath the main subject, suggesting it's part of a larger plant structure.\n\nThere are no discernible texts or human-made objects in the image, reinforcing the sense of being deep within nature. The relative position of the flower suggests it was photographed at eye level, allowing for a clear view of both the top and bottom parts of the blossom. There are no actions taking place; instead, the image conveys a stillness, as if capturing a quiet moment on a serene pond surface. \n\nOverall, the image presents a detailed snapshot of a blooming lotus, highlighting not only the beauty of individual flowers but also their role within a broader ecosystem."

This juxtaposition creates a humorous contrast between one of history's most famous scientists from the early 20th century and contemporary technological devices that didn't exist during Einstein's lifetime. It highlights how far we've come in terms of communication tools since then and serves as a reminder of just how rapidly our world has evolved over time."
